TextToVideoGenerator

This repository provides a framework for generating videos from text descriptions using diffusion models.

Key Features:

Text Feature Extraction: Converts textual descriptions into numerical representations suitable for model input.
Video Generation: Generates video frames based on extracted text features.
Model Training: Trains the diffusion model on a dataset of text-video pairs.
Requirements:

Python
PyTorch
Required libraries (specified in the code)
Usage:

Clone the repository.
Install required dependencies.
Prepare your dataset (or use a pre-trained model).
Modify hyperparameters as needed.
Run the training script.
Structure:

code: Contains Python scripts for the model, training, and evaluation.
data: Stores input text and corresponding video data.
models: Saves trained models.
outputs: Stores generated videos.
Additional Notes:

The code includes functions for data preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation.
Hyperparameter tuning is essential for optimal performance.
Consider exploring different diffusion model architectures and loss functions.
